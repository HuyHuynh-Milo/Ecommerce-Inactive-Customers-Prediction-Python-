# ðŸ“ˆ Ecommerce-Inactive-Customers-Analysis-&-Prediction-Python

:warning: Customer churn leads to substantial profit loss in e-commerce businesses. 
This project aims to identify churn drivers and predict the probability of churn using a full machine learning pipelineâ€”data preprocessing, EDA, feature engineering, modeling, and evaluation using Python libraries such as Pandas, Scikit-learn, and Matplotlib.

## :memo: Background & Overview:

:dagger: Objective: 

This project investigates a customers characteristics dataset using Python in Google Colab, answering questions about churn drivers and behavior most related to the leaving of customers. 

- Finding top features strongly affects the inactivity of users
- Dive into these features, such as Tenure, Cashback, etc., to find some relationship
- Analyze key metrics engagement (login device, order category,...)
- Building a Machine Learning process and evaluating the best model to predict churn users
- Clustering churned users to uncover some properties for win-back strategies
